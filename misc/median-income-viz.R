# Your job is to update the TODOs below to recreate this visualization
# https://show.rfor.us/4MwDlgt2

# A couple notes:
# 1. The house icon was added outside of R. Don't worry about adding it.
# 2. The colors you can use to get close to the viz are "darkgreen" and "gray"
# 3. Don't worry about adding the Median Household Income title

# This is part of Oregon by the Numbers
# See https://www.tfff.org/oregon-numbers/
